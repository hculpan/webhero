# WebHero

This is my first Spring Boot project based on the tutorial found at https://springframework.guru/spring-boot-web-application-part-3-spring-data-jpa/.

The eventual intent will be to build this into a full project allowing people to help manage FTF Champions games, to be deployed to an AWS EC2 instance using DynamoDB as the data store.
